    "section": "",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe topic we are interested in exploring for this project is what types of music have historically charted on the Billboard Hot 100, which has published the top 100 songs in the U.S. based on sales, radio play, and streaming weekly since 1958. More specifically, we want to know what makes a song more likely to chart than others; is it something to do with the genre, tempo, energy of the song? The artists featured in the song? The song’s producers? The instruments used in a song? The lyrical composition? Moreover, since the Billboard Hot 100 has existed since 1958, we are interested in seeing how popular music has evolved over time. As an example, a #1 hit in 1960 isn’t directly comparable to a #1 hit in 2010; we are interested in exploring how exactly they differ across multiple metrics.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe dataset we will be using for this project can be found here: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2025/2025-08-26/readme.md\nThe data contains every song to ever top the Billboard Hot 100 between August 4, 1958 and January 11, 2025 and is compiled by Chris Dalla Riva as an accompaniment to his book “Uncharted Territory: What Numbers Tell Us about the Biggest Hit Songs and Ourselves” being published this November. The dataset itself contains data from multiple sources aside from the author, including BPM metrics provided by Spotify, genre details provided by Discogs, and other variables citing Tidal, Songview, and Fred Bronson’s “The Billboard Book of Number One” as sources.\nWe chose this dataset specifically because it has numerous variables that will let us explore in depth the various relationships among musical, lyrical, and production characteristics between the top songs. We were also drawn to it because we both love music and wanted a personally engaging project. However, we spotted potential issues with the data. The “label” variable, for example, provides the name of the label under which the song was distributed. This could be a problem when looking at distribution of songs under certain labels over time, since businesses often experience rapid changes (e.g. maybe a label was acquired by another company, some labels could have gone through bankruptcy, some labels might have rebranded). Another potential issue is that there are multiple variables for song genre in the dataset, one assigned subjectively by the author, and one assigned by Discogs. This subjectivity poses a problem when looking at genre popularity over time.",

Variables with &gt;0.8 missing\nThere are only a few variables that have &gt;0.8 of its values missing:\nfeatured_artists, talent_contestant, sound_effects, featured_in_a_then_contemporary_play, featured_in_a_then_contemporary_film, featured_in_a_then_contemporary_t_v_show, double_a_side\nFor these variables, it makes sense why so many of its values would be missing. Not every song would have a featured artist, or have the main artist be from a talent competition, etc. They are not missing because of corrupt data. We will thus leave these columns out of our analyses.\n\n\n2.2.3 2. Missing variables with known documentation\nThe following variables have explanations in the documentation for its missing values\n\nbpm, energy, danceability, happiness, loudness_d_b, acousticness –&gt; 0.0016\n\nThese variables are taken from Spotify data, so they are presumably missing from the dataset because the data is not available through Spotify. Below, I have created a data frame containing rows missing the above Spotify variables. It looks like there are 2 songs responsible for these missing values: “Rock On” by Michael Damian and “Lately” by Divine.\n\n\nCode\nspotify_missing &lt;- billboard |&gt;\n  filter(is.na(bpm) | is.na(energy) | is.na(danceability) | is.na(happiness) | is.na(loudness_d_b) | is.na(acousticness))\n\nspotify_missing\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 105\n  song   artist date                weeks_at_number_one non_consecutive rating_1\n  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dttm&gt;                            &lt;dbl&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Rock … Micha… 1989-06-03 00:00:00                   1               0        2\n2 Lately Divine 1998-11-28 00:00:00                   1               0        6\n# ℹ 99 more variables: rating_2 &lt;dbl&gt;, rating_3 &lt;dbl&gt;, overall_rating &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   divisiveness &lt;dbl&gt;, label &lt;chr&gt;, parent_label &lt;chr&gt;, cdr_genre &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   cdr_style &lt;chr&gt;, discogs_genre &lt;chr&gt;, discogs_style &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   artist_structure &lt;dbl&gt;, featured_artists &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   multiple_lead_vocalists &lt;dbl&gt;, group_named_after_non_lead_singer &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   talent_contestant &lt;chr&gt;, posthumous &lt;dbl&gt;, artist_place_of_origin &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   front_person_age &lt;dbl&gt;, artist_male &lt;dbl&gt;, artist_white &lt;dbl&gt;, …\n\n\n\nfront_person_age\n\nAs per the data documentation, “If [front_person_age is] blank, then the age(s) could not be accurately located or age did not make sense (i.e., the band was animated)”.\n\n\nCode\nfront_person_missing &lt;- billboard |&gt;\n  filter(is.na(front_person_age))\n\nfront_person_missing\n\n\n# A tibble: 22 × 105\n   song  artist date                weeks_at_number_one non_consecutive rating_1\n   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dttm&gt;                            &lt;dbl&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Blue… The M… 1961-04-03 00:00:00                   3               0        8\n 2 The … The T… 1961-12-18 00:00:00                   3               0        9\n 3 Tels… The T… 1962-12-22 00:00:00                   3               0        8\n 4 So M… The T… 1963-08-03 00:00:00                   1               0        8\n 5 Ince… Straw… 1967-11-25 00:00:00                   1               0        3\n 6 Suga… The A… 1969-09-20 00:00:00                   4               0        7\n 7 Want… Honey… 1971-06-12 00:00:00                   1               0        7\n 8 TSOP… MFSB   1974-04-20 00:00:00                   2               0        8\n 9 Bill… Bo Do… 1974-06-15 00:00:00                   2               0        2\n10 Fire  Ohio … 1975-02-08 00:00:00                   1               0        8\n# ℹ 12 more rows\n# ℹ 99 more variables: rating_2 &lt;dbl&gt;, rating_3 &lt;dbl&gt;, overall_rating &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   divisiveness &lt;dbl&gt;, label &lt;chr&gt;, parent_label &lt;chr&gt;, cdr_genre &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   cdr_style &lt;chr&gt;, discogs_genre &lt;chr&gt;, discogs_style &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   artist_structure &lt;dbl&gt;, featured_artists &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   multiple_lead_vocalists &lt;dbl&gt;, group_named_after_non_lead_singer &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   talent_contestant &lt;chr&gt;, posthumous &lt;dbl&gt;, artist_place_of_origin &lt;chr&gt;, …\n\n\n\n\n2.2.4 3. Remaining missing variables\nWe will now do a short investigation on the other variables:\n\nlabel, parent_label –&gt; 0.0008\n\nThere is only 1 song contributing to these variables’ missing values, and it is “Rich Men North of Richmond” by Oliver Anthony. Upon a quick Google search, this song has no label/parent label because it was self released. This is interesting to note as it is the only song to have charted #1 in the Billboard Hot 100 to be self released!\n\n\nCode\nlabel_missing &lt;- billboard |&gt;\n  filter(is.na(label) | is.na(parent_label))\n\nlabel_missing\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 105\n  song   artist date                weeks_at_number_one non_consecutive rating_1\n  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dttm&gt;                            &lt;dbl&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Rich … Olive… 2023-08-26 00:00:00                   2               0        5\n# ℹ 99 more variables: rating_2 &lt;dbl&gt;, rating_3 &lt;dbl&gt;, overall_rating &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   divisiveness &lt;dbl&gt;, label &lt;chr&gt;, parent_label &lt;chr&gt;, cdr_genre &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   cdr_style &lt;chr&gt;, discogs_genre &lt;chr&gt;, discogs_style &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   artist_structure &lt;dbl&gt;, featured_artists &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   multiple_lead_vocalists &lt;dbl&gt;, group_named_after_non_lead_singer &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   talent_contestant &lt;chr&gt;, posthumous &lt;dbl&gt;, artist_place_of_origin &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   front_person_age &lt;dbl&gt;, artist_male &lt;dbl&gt;, artist_white &lt;dbl&gt;, …\n\n\n\ncdr_genre, cdr_style -&gt; 0.0747\ndiscogs_genre -&gt; 0.0135\ndiscogs_style -&gt; 0.0212\n\n\n\nCode\ngenres &lt;- billboard |&gt;\n  select(cdr_genre, cdr_style, discogs_genre, discogs_style)\n\nplot_missing(genres)\n\n\nScale for y is already present.\nAdding another scale for y, which will replace the existing scale.\nScale for y is already present.\nAdding another scale for y, which will replace the existing scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation 1: There are some instances of discogs_genre != NA and discogs_style = NA where discogs_style is supposed to be “None” (example: The style for “STAY” by Kid Laroi being NA but “Save Your Tears” by The Weeknd being “None”, despite both of them being absent from Discogs).\n\n[IN CLEANING FUNCTION] Change all “NA” on discogs_style where discogs_genre is not NA to be “None”\n\nObservation 2: There are many instances of cdr_genre and cdr_style = NA where discogs are NOT NA.\n\nSince cdr_genre and cdr_style are both subjective interpretations of genre and style from the author, Chris Dalla Riva, we cannot just impute these missing values with our own interpretations. We will be using discogs_genre and discogs_style for genre/style analyses instead.\n\nObservation 3: Only 16 NA instances of BOTH cdr_genre/cdr_style and discogs_genre/discogs_style despite information being available on Discogs\n\nWe discovered that these NA instances are likely because the scraping script Chris Dalla Riva used to retrieve genre/style information from Discogs only takes into account songs that appear on Discogs’ “Releases” collection. Some songs that have charted only appear on the album it is part of, under Discogs’ “Master” collection.\n[IN CLEANING FUNCTION] We have created our own script (discogs_scrape.py) to scrape the genre/style of these 16 missing instances in the dataset so that we can have complete genre/style columns under discogs_genre and discogs_style. Thus, our genre/style analyses will only be using the aforementioned variables.\n\n\nartist_black -&gt; 0.0535\n\nThey should definitely not be missing because it is a dummy for whether the artist is Black or not. Beyonce, for example, should be a 1. There are 63 missing instances, which would be time consuming to impute. Since artist_white is complete, we might just use it for our analyses instead.\n\n\nCode\nblack_missing &lt;- billboard |&gt;\n  filter(is.na(artist_black))\n\ndim(black_missing)\n\n\n[1]  63 105\n\n\n\nsongwriters_w_o_interpolation_sample_credits -&gt; 0.0008\n\nThere is only 1 missing for songwriters_w_o_interpolation_sample_credits and I think this is a mistake. The songwriters listed in the songwriters column are the songwriters that should be in the songwriters_w_o_interpolation_sample_credits column because they are not sampled songwriters.\n\n[IN CLEANING FUNCTION] We will just impute the missing value for this 1 instance with whatever is in the songwriters column\n\n\nsongwriter_male , songwriter_white -&gt; 0.00169\n\nThe only 2 songs with songwriter_male and songwriter_white missing are the only 2 songs with songwriters listed as “Unknown”.

Our guess? With streaming, viral trends, and global platforms like TikTok, a single breakout hit can dominate for months instead of passing the crown every week like songs often did in the past.\nTo see this trend more clearly, we visualize how long songs stay at #1 using a boxplot across decades.\n\n\nCode\n# Box plot of weeks at #1 across decades\n# Ensure each song has a single decade (counts the first decade it shows up in)\nbillboard_unique &lt;- billboard_updated |&gt;\n  group_by(song) |&gt;\n  summarize(decade = first(decade), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n# Prepare weeks_by_song + decade\n\nweeks_by_song &lt;- billboard_updated |&gt;\n  distinct(song, artist, weeks_at_number_one) |&gt;\n  mutate(weeks_at_number_one = as.integer(weeks_at_number_one))\n\nweeks_with_decade &lt;- weeks_by_song |&gt;\n  left_join(billboard_unique, by = \"song\") |&gt;\n  mutate(decade = factor(decade))  # ensure decade is categorical\n\n# Boxplot of weeks at #1 by decade\np_box &lt;- ggplot(weeks_with_decade, aes(x = decade, y = weeks_at_number_one)) +\n  geom_boxplot(outlier.size = 1, varwidth = TRUE, fill = \"pink3\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Weeks at #1 by Decade\",\n    x = \"Decade\",\n    y = \"Weeks at #1\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\nprint(p_box)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs expected from the 1950s through the 1990s, the median #1 song stayed at the top for only about 2 weeks. Lots of turnover, lots of variety.\nStarting in the 2000s, the median creeps upward; songs begin hanging onto the top spot a bit longer on average. This tracks with the rise of digital downloads, early streaming, and algorithm-driven discovery.\nExtreme outliers (those mega-hits that stay #1 for 10, 12, 16+ weeks) slowly increase from the 1950s through the 1990s, showing that “dominant hits” were becoming a bigger part of the chart long before streaming arrived.\nEven with only five years of data, the 2020s already show seven outlier songs, the most of any decade so far. This suggests the most concentrated chart dominance we’ve ever seen, which is exactly what you’d expect in a hyper-viral, algorithm-powered music world.",

These marathon hits linger at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 for weeks, sometimes months, becoming the soundtrack of entire seasons.\nAfter seeing how outliers in the boxplot grew more extreme over time, we wanted to dig deeper: which songs dominated the longest, and how has that changed across decades?\nTo answer that, we looked at two things:\n\nThe top 10 longest-running #1 songs of all time; and\nThe single longest-running #1 song from each decade\n\n\n\nCode\n# Identify marathon hits (10+ weeks)\nsong_runs &lt;- billboard_updated |&gt;\n  distinct(song, artist, weeks_at_number_one, year, decade, date) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    song_id = paste0(song, \" — \", artist),\n    weeks_at_number_one = as.integer(weeks_at_number_one),\n    month = month(date, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE)\n  )\n\ntop10_alltime &lt;- song_runs |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(weeks_at_number_one)) |&gt;\n  slice_head(n = 10)\n\nlongest_per_decade &lt;- song_runs |&gt;\n  group_by(decade) |&gt;\n  slice_max(weeks_at_number_one, n = 1, with_ties = FALSE) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\nmarathon_hits &lt;- song_runs |&gt;\n  mutate(type = ifelse(weeks_at_number_one &gt;= 10, \"marathon\", \"typical\"))\n\nmarathon_hits_only &lt;- marathon_hits |&gt;\n  filter(type == \"marathon\")\n\n\nBelow are the top 10 longest-running #1 songs of all time, with the highest number of weeks being 19.\n\n\nCode\ntop10_alltime\n\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 8\n   song         artist weeks_at_number_one  year decade date       song_id month\n   &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;date&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;ord&gt;\n 1 Old Town Ro… Lil N…                  19  2019   2010 2019-04-13 Old To… Apr  \n 2 A Bar Song … Shabo…                  19  2024   2020 2024-07-13 A Bar … Jul  \n 3 One Sweet D… Maria…                  16  1995   1990 1995-12-02 One Sw… Dec  \n 4 Despacito    Luis …                  16  2017   2010 2017-05-27 Despac… May  \n 5 Last Night   Morga…                  16  2023   2020 2023-03-18 Last N… Mar  \n 6 As It Was    Harry…                  15  2022   2020 2022-04-16 As It … Apr  \n 7 I Will Alwa… Whitn…                  14  1992   1990 1992-11-28 I Will… Nov  \n 8 I'll Make L… Boyz …                  14  1994   1990 1994-08-27 I'll M… Aug  \n 9 Macarena (B… Los d…                  14  1996   1990 1996-08-03 Macare… Aug  \n10 Candle in t… Elton…                  14  1997   1990 1997-10-11 Candle… Oct  \n\n\nBelow are the longest-running #1 songs for every decade.\n\n\nCode\nlongest_per_decade\n\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 8\n  song          artist weeks_at_number_one  year decade date       song_id month\n  &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;date&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;ord&gt;\n1 Mack the Kni… Bobby…                   9  1959   1950 1959-10-05 Mack t… Oct  \n2 Theme from A… Percy…                   9  1960   1960 1960-02-22 Theme … Feb  \n3 You Light Up… Debby…                  10  1977   1970 1977-10-15 You Li… Oct  \n4 Physical      Olivi…                  10  1981   1980 1981-11-21 Physic… Nov  \n5 One Sweet Day Maria…                  16  1995   1990 1995-12-02 One Sw… Dec  \n6 We Belong To… Maria…                  14  2005   2000 2005-06-04 We Bel… Jun  \n7 Old Town Road Lil N…                  19  2019   2010 2019-04-13 Old To… Apr  \n8 A Bar Song (… Shabo…                  19  2024   2020 2024-07-13 A Bar … Jul  \n\n\nThe biggest takeaway isn’t that all long-running hits are modern, it’s that the ceiling jumped dramatically in the streaming era.\nEarlier decades topped out around 10 weeks. The 1990s broke through that barrier with 16 weeks, and the 2010s–2020s shattered it with close to 20 weeks.\nStreaming didn’t just reshape music consumption - it supercharged chart dominance.\nAfter identifying the marathon hits (songs staying at #1 for 10+ weeks), we also wondered whether they tended to break through at certain times of the year. Do dominant songs arrive with the summer heat? The back-to-school lull? The holiday season?\n\n\nCode\n# Plot 2: Bar Chart of Marathon Hits by Month\n# Count marathon hits per month\nmarathon_month_counts &lt;- marathon_hits_only |&gt;\n  count(month)\n\n# Bar chart of marathon hits by month\nggplot(marathon_month_counts, aes(x = month, y = n)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"lightsteelblue2\", color = \"black\", width = 0.9) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Month When Marathon Hits First Reached #1\",\n    subtitle = \"Songs with 10+ consecutive weeks at #1\",\n    x = \"Month\",\n    y = \"Number of Marathon Hits\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurprisingly, the seasonality story isn’t as predictable as you’d think:\n\nApril and November lead the pack with 6 marathon hits each\nNovember kind of makes sense; holiday listening often propels songs into the new year\nApril is the real wildcard with no obvious cultural explanation\nDecember, the peak holiday season, produced only 3 marathon hits\n\nOverall, there’s no single “magic month.” Dominance depends more on cultural moments and viral momentum than the calendar.\n\n\n3.2.2 One Week Wonders Across Decades\nSince marathon hits only make up a small proportion of the data, we thought we would be able to learn more from looking into one-week wonders - songs that were only #1 for one week. First, we wanted to look at what percentage of the songs were so-called “one-week wonders”.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate percentage of #1 songs with only 1 week at the top\none_week_pct &lt;- weeks_by_song |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    one_week_count = sum(weeks_at_number_one == 1, na.rm = TRUE),\n    total_songs = n(),\n    pct = one_week_count / total_songs * 100\n  )\n\none_week_pct\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  one_week_count total_songs   pct\n           &lt;int&gt;       &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1            426        1177  36.2\n\n\nThat means roughly 1 in 3 #1 hits were “one-week wonders”, topping the chart briefly before being replaced.\nWhat about per decade?\n\n\nCode\n# Compute summary per decade\none_week_by_decade &lt;- billboard_updated |&gt;\n  distinct(song, artist, decade, weeks_at_number_one) |&gt;   # one row per song\n  group_by(decade) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    total_songs = n(),\n    one_week_count = sum(weeks_at_number_one == 1),\n    pct_one_week = one_week_count / total_songs * 100\n  ) |&gt;\n  arrange(decade)\n\none_week_by_decade\n\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 4\n  decade total_songs one_week_count pct_one_week\n   &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;int&gt;          &lt;int&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1   1950          23              5         21.7\n2   1960         203             55         27.1\n3   1970         253            126         49.8\n4   1980         231             91         39.4\n5   1990         140             39         27.9\n6   2000         129             31         24.0\n7   2010         116             33         28.4\n8   2020          82             46         56.1\n\n\nCode\none_week_by_year &lt;- billboard_updated |&gt;\n  distinct(song, artist, year, weeks_at_number_one) |&gt; \n  group_by(year) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    total_songs = n(),\n    one_week_count = sum(weeks_at_number_one == 1),\n    pct_one_week = one_week_count / total_songs * 100\n  ) |&gt;\n  arrange(year)\n\none_week_by_decade$decade &lt;- factor(one_week_by_decade$decade, \n                                    levels = sort(unique(one_week_by_decade$decade)))\none_week_by_year$year &lt;- as.integer(one_week_by_year$year)\n\n\n\n\nCode\np_decade &lt;- ggplot(one_week_by_decade, aes(x = decade, y = pct_one_week)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.2, color = \"indianred4\", group = 1) +\n  geom_point(size = 3, color = \"indianred4\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(drop = FALSE) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"One-Week Wonders per Decade\",\n    x = \"Decade\",\n    y = \"% of Songs with Only 1 Week at #1\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\nCode\np_year &lt;- ggplot(one_week_by_year, aes(x = year, y = pct_one_week)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1, color = \"plum\") +\n  geom_point(size = 1.5, color = \"plum\") +\n geom_text(\n    aes(label = year),\n    nudge_y = 1,        # move label slightly up from the point\n    size = 3,           # text size\n    check_overlap = TRUE\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"One-Week Wonders per Year\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"% of Songs with Only 1 Week at #1\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\np_decade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\np_year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the charts above, we can deduce that the 2020s have the highest one-week wonder rate in history, likely due to streaming algorithms favoring new releases, viral TikTok trends creating rapid chart movements, increased competition and shorter attention spans.\nThis is interesting because we would have assumed that, due to the increased marathon runners in the streaming era, we would have less one-week wonders in the 2020s. We see this pattern emerge in some years like 2002 and 2014 with none such one-week wonders at all, in addition to the lull in one-week wonders around the 1990s to mid 2010s. However, it is unclear why we are suddenly seeing a surge after 2014.\nOverall, chart dynamics aren’t linear - they respond to cultural and technological shifts in waves.",

    "text": "3.3 🎵 “I’ve Been Afraid of Changing” 🎵\nThe world looks different now in 2025 than it did in 1950, and so did the music we listen to. Here, we explore how music has changed across decades. Do they sound different musically? Are we using different instruments than we did 70 years ago? Are we listening to more singer-songwriters than bands?\n\n3.3.1 Instrumentation and Sound Evolution\nWith rapid shifts in technological advancement, there is no doubt that songs now are being produced using different methods of instrumentation than in the decades past. We explore this evolution of sound by creating PCA biplots that will help us compare variables like bpm, energy, danceability, happiness, etc.\n\n\nCode\nsong_vars &lt;- billboard_updated |&gt;\n  select(song, decade, bpm, energy, danceability, happiness, loudness_d_b,\n         acousticness, length_sec, instrumental_length_sec)\nsong_vars &lt;- song_vars |&gt; drop_na()\n\n\n\n\nCode\nbillboard_20th &lt;- song_vars |&gt; filter(decade &lt; 2000)\nbillboard_21st &lt;- song_vars |&gt; filter(decade &gt;= 2000)\n\nsong_vars_20th &lt;- billboard_20th |&gt; \n  select(bpm, energy, danceability, happiness, loudness_d_b,\n         acousticness, length_sec, instrumental_length_sec)\n\nsong_vars_21st &lt;- billboard_21st |&gt; \n  select(bpm, energy, danceability, happiness, loudness_d_b,\n         acousticness, length_sec, instrumental_length_sec)\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndraw_biplot(song_vars_20th, label_size = 2, point_size = 0.2, point_color = \"lightsteelblue2\", vector_colors = \"maroon\", point_labels = FALSE) +\n  ggtitle(\"Biplot: Songs Before 2000\")\n\n\nWarning: ggrepel: 767 unlabeled data points (too many overlaps). Consider\nincreasing max.overlaps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndraw_biplot(song_vars_21st, label_size = 3, point_size = 0.2, point_color = \"lightsteelblue2\", vector_colors = \"maroon\", point_labels = FALSE) +\n  ggtitle(\"Biplot: Songs From 2000 Onward\")\n\n\nWarning: ggrepel: 233 unlabeled data points (too many overlaps). Consider\nincreasing max.overlaps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier decades show a tightly linked cluster of danceability, energy, and loudness - a sign that upbeat songs tended to be uniformly bright, energetic, and dance-friendly (think disco, classic pop, 80s synths, and power ballads). BPM and happiness were also closely aligned, suggesting that “fast = cheerful” was a common formula for a hit. Acousticness sat far from the energy/danceability cluster, which suggests that acoustic songs rarely overlapped with dance-heavy tracks.\nThis reflects a time when genres were more distinct, and production styles followed clearer rules.\nPost 2000s, danceability no longer correlates with acousticness, suggesting that modern songs tend to blend “dance-friendly” rhythms with acoustic textures (think Ed Sheeran or folk-pop crossovers). BPM and happiness no longer travel together, which means a fast song doesn’t have to feel bright or positive (hyperpop sadness or moody EDM).\nPut simply: modern hits don’t follow the old blueprints anymore. Genre fluidity, bedroom pop production, and algorithm-driven trends allow features to recombine in ways that were rare before 2000.\n\n\n3.3.2 Evolution of Genre Across Decades\nWhen we think 1960s-70s, rock immediately comes to mind as the defining music genre of that time. When we think 2010-2020s, we think of indie, hip-hop, and pop. But will this reflect in the Billboard Hot 100? To test our hypothesis, we create a heatmap of the proportion of genres of #1 songs for each decade. Since songs could have more than one genre, we define the proportion of a genre as how many times a genre appeared in that decade divided by the total number of songs that appeared in that decade.\n\n\nCode\n# Genre representation\n\n# Separate rows with multiple genres\ngenres_billboard &lt;- billboard_updated |&gt;\n  separate_rows(discogs_genre, sep=\";\") |&gt;\n  mutate(genre_sep = str_trim(discogs_genre)) |&gt;\n  filter(genre_sep != \"\")\n\n# Count songs by decade and genre\ngenre_counts &lt;- genres_billboard |&gt;\n  group_by(decade, genre_sep) |&gt;\n  summarise(n_genre = n(), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n# Count unique songs per decade\ndecade_totals &lt;- billboard_updated |&gt;\n  group_by(decade) |&gt;\n  summarise(n_total = n(), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n# Calculate proportion of genre per decade\ngenre_prop &lt;- genre_counts |&gt;\n  left_join(decade_totals, by = \"decade\") |&gt;\n  mutate(proportion = n_genre/n_total)\n\n# Heatmap data\nheatmap_genre &lt;- genre_prop |&gt;\n  select(decade, genre_sep, proportion)\n\n# Ordering by average proportion for genres\ngenre_avg &lt;- heatmap_genre |&gt;\n  group_by(genre_sep) |&gt;\n  summarise(avg_prop = mean(proportion, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  arrange(avg_prop)\n\nheatmap_genre &lt;- heatmap_genre |&gt;\n  mutate(genre_sep = factor(genre_sep, levels = genre_avg$genre_sep))\n\n# Create the heatmap\nggplot(heatmap_genre, aes(x = decade, y = genre_sep, fill = proportion)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low=\"lightsteelblue1\", high = \"royalblue4\", name = \"Genre Proportion\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=unique(heatmap_genre$decade)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Heatmap of Genre per Decade\",\n    subtitle = \"In decreasing order of average proportion\",\n    x = \"Decade\",\n    y = \"Genre\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe heat map above shows us that Pop has always been a popular (haha) genre, which is not surprising. It lost to Rock as the genre with the most #1 songs in the 60s and 70s, though. We also see that Hip Hop as a genre did not even show up in any of the #1 songs until the 1980s, and since then has consistently charted, with the peak being in the 2000s. Almost opposite to Hip Hop is Rock, which was prominent in the 50s to 80s, but quickly lost its popularity from the 1990s onwards.\n\n\n3.3.3 Solo/Duo/Group Artists vs Featured Collaborations\nJust like we picture the 60s and 70s to be the defining decades for Rock, we also picture the 60s and 70s to be the defining decades for bands. Names like “The Beatles” and “Fleetwood Mac” - both bands - come to mind as prominent artists of that era, whereas names like “Taylor Swift” and “Ariana Grande” - solo artists - come to mind as prominent artists of the era we are in right now. To test this hypothesis, we create a mosaic plot that shows us the distribution of artist structure (group, duo, solo) and featured collaborations per decade.\n\n\nCode\n# Solo artists vs groups vs collaborations\n\n# Separating between solo, duo and group\n# Separating between feature vs no feature\nbb_artist &lt;- billboard_updated |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    artist_type = case_when(\n      artist_structure %in% c(0, 0.5) ~ \"Group\",\n      artist_structure %in% c(1, 1.5) ~ \"Solo\",\n      artist_structure %in% c(2, 2.5) ~ \"Duo\"\n    ),\n    has_feature = ifelse(artist_structure %% 1 == 0.5, \"With Feature\", \"No Feature\"),\n    artist_type = factor(artist_type, levels = c(\"Group\", \"Duo\", \"Solo\")),\n    era_detailed = case_when(\n      decade &lt; 1990 ~ \"Before 1990\", \n      decade &gt;= 1990 & decade &lt; 2010 ~ \"1990-2009\",\n      decade &gt;= 2010 ~ \"2010-2025\"\n      ),\n    era_detailed = factor(era_detailed, levels = c(\"Before 1990\", \"1990-2009\", \"2010-2025\"))\n  )\n\n# Stacked bar chart with artist structure\nstructure_chart &lt;- ggplot(data = bb_artist, aes(x = decade, fill = artist_type)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = unique(bb_artist$decade), trans = \"reverse\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\"Solo\" = \"lightsteelblue2\", \"Duo\" = \"lightsteelblue3\", \"Group\" = \"lightsteelblue4\"),\n    name = \"Artist Structure\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"How Has Artist Structure Changed?\",\n    x = \"Decade\",\n    y = \"Song Proportion\"\n  ) +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n# Stacked bar chart with artist feature\nfeature_chart &lt;- ggplot(data = bb_artist, aes(x = era_detailed, fill = has_feature)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\"With Feature\" = \"indianred4\", \"No Feature\" = \"indianred3\"),\n    name = \"Feature\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"How Have Music Collaborations Changed?\",\n    x = \"Era\",\n    y = \"Proportion of Features\"\n  )\n\nstructure_chart &lt;- structure_chart +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 9),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 8),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 9),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 8),\n    legend.title = element_text(size = 9)\n  )\n\nfeature_chart &lt;- feature_chart +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 9),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 6),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 9),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 8),\n    legend.title = element_text(size = 9)\n  )\n\nstructure_chart + feature_chart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese two stacked bar charts confirm my hypothesis. Firstly, it shows us that group artists are slowly becoming less popular every decade. In the 1960s, group artists made up most of the #1 songs, where now, it is dominated by solo artists. Secondly, it shows us that virtually no featured collaborations made it to #1 before the 1990s, which is consistent with a 2018 report from The Economist telling us that collaboration in music is a relatively recent phenomena.",

How have they changed across decades?\n\n3.4.1 Top Artists Over the Years\nOur data spans 1950 to 2025, so we are interested in looking at the top artists of all time (artists that have the most songs at #1 in the Billboard Hot 100) and what years they were popular. For instance, were The Beatles only popular for a certain time or do they have songs that are #1 even now?\n\n\nCode\n# Get top 20 artists\ntop_20_artists &lt;- billboard_updated |&gt;\n  count(artist, sort = TRUE) |&gt;\n  slice_head(n = 20) |&gt;\n  pull(artist)\n\n# Get first and last year for each artist\nartist_timeline &lt;- billboard_updated |&gt;\n  filter(artist %in% top_20_artists) |&gt;\n  group_by(artist) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    first_year = min(year, na.rm = TRUE),\n    last_year = max(year, na.rm = TRUE),\n    n_songs = n()\n  ) |&gt;\n  arrange(first_year, desc(n_songs)) |&gt;\n  mutate(artist = factor(artist, levels = rev(artist)))\n\n# Get individual songs for points\nartist_songs &lt;- billboard_updated |&gt;\n  filter(artist %in% top_20_artists) |&gt;\n  select(artist, year) |&gt;\n  left_join(artist_timeline |&gt; select(artist), by = \"artist\") |&gt;\n  mutate(artist = factor(artist, levels = levels(artist_timeline$artist)))\n\n# Create timeline plot\nggplot(artist_timeline, aes(y = artist)) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x = first_year, xend = last_year, yend = artist),\n               alpha = 1, size = 0.5, color = \"black\") +\n  geom_point(data = artist_songs, aes(x = year, y = artist), \n             color = \"royalblue4\", alpha = 0.5, size = 4) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Active Years for Top 20 Artists with #1 Songs\",\n    subtitle = \"Each dot represents a song that charted as #1\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Artist\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chart above takes the top 20 artists of all time and marks the first year and the most recent year in which their song hit #1. While most of these artists are not popular for more than 10 years, there are some interesting anomalies. Mariah Carey, for example, first hit #1 in the mid 1990s and last hit #1 in 2019, although it looks she was more consistently popular in the 1990s, falling off after 2000. The Beatles and The Supremes have almost the opposite story, with their reign of popularity only taking up a few years despite having many more songs hit #1.\n\n\n3.4.2 Are #1 Artists & Songwriters Becoming More Diverse?\nWith more and more opportunities being presented to artists of color and women artists over the years, we would imagine there being a stark difference between the gender and race distribution of #1 artists now than in 1950. We test this hypothesis by creating two mosaic plots exploring the effect of gender and race on era (defined as before 1990 and after 1990).\n\n\nCode\n# Artist Gender and Race\nartist_data &lt;- billboard_updated |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    gender = case_when(\n      artist_male == 0 ~ \"All Female\",\n      artist_male == 1 ~ \"All Male\",\n      artist_male == 2 | artist_male == 3 ~ \"Mixed Gender\"\n    ),\n    race = case_when(\n      artist_white == 0 ~ \"Not White\",\n      artist_white == 1 ~ \"White\",\n      artist_white == 2 ~ \"Mixed Race\"\n    ),\n    era_detailed = case_when(\n      decade &lt; 1990 ~ \"Before 1990\", \n      decade &gt;= 1990 ~ \"After 1990\"\n      ),\n    era_detailed = factor(era_detailed, levels = c(\"Before 1990\", \"After 1990\")),\n    gender = factor(gender, levels = c(\"All Male\", \"All Female\", \"Mixed Gender\"))\n  ) |&gt;\n  select(artist, decade, gender, race, era_detailed) |&gt;\n  distinct()\n\n# define grayscale palette\nshades &lt;- c(\"Mixed Race\" = \"plum\", \n            \"Not White\" = \"lightsteelblue2\", \n            \"White\" = \"indianred4\")\n\nvcd::mosaic(~era_detailed + gender + race,\n       data = artist_data,\n       direction = c(\"v\", \"v\", \"h\"),\n       main = \"Artist Gender and Race Interaction\",\n       highlighting = \"race\",\n       highlighting_fill = shades,\n       main_gp = gpar(fontsize = 12),\n       labeling_args = list(\n         gp_labels = gpar(fontsize = 5),   # Adjust category label font size\n         gp_varnames = gpar(fontsize = 7) # Adjust variable names font size\n       ))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mosaic plot above confirms our hypothesis and shows us that, before 1990, “All Male” seemed to take up the biggest proportion of artists, with more than 2/3 of these male artists being white. “All Female” and “Mixed Gender” artists had similar proportions, but both were still overwhelmingly white.\nAfter 1990, it still looks like “All Male” artists dominate #1 compared to “All Female” and “Mixed Gender” artists, but the distribution of race makes a dramatic 180. Now, half of the male artists are not white, compared to before 1990 where not white artists only made up less than 1/3 of all male artists. This is a huge improvement for the distribution of race in our #1 artists!\n\n\nCode\n# Top Songwriters\nsongwriter_data &lt;- billboard_updated |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    gender = case_when(\n      songwriter_male == 0 ~ \"All Female\",\n      songwriter_male == 1 ~ \"All Male\",\n      songwriter_male == 2 | songwriter_male == 3 ~ \"Mixed Gender\"\n    ),\n    race = case_when(\n      songwriter_white == 0 ~ \"Not White\",\n      songwriter_white == 1 ~ \"White\",\n      songwriter_white == 2 ~ \"Mixed Race\"\n    ),\n    era_detailed = case_when(\n      decade &lt; 1990 ~ \"Before 1990\", \n      decade &gt;= 1990 ~ \"After 1990\"\n      ),\n    era_detailed = factor(era_detailed, levels = c(\"Before 1990\", \"After 1990\")),\n    gender = factor(gender, levels = c(\"All Male\", \"All Female\", \"Mixed Gender\"))\n  ) |&gt;\n  select(songwriters, gender, race, era_detailed) |&gt;\n  drop_na() |&gt;\n  distinct()\n\n# define grayscale palette\nshades &lt;- c(\"Mixed Race\" = \"plum\", \n            \"Not White\" = \"lightblue\", \n            \"White\" = \"indianred4\")\n\nvcd::mosaic(~era_detailed + gender + race,\n       data = songwriter_data,\n       direction = c(\"v\", \"v\", \"h\"),\n       main = \"Songwriter Gender and Race Interaction\",\n       highlighting = \"race\",\n       highlighting_fill = shades,\n       main_gp = gpar(fontsize = 12),\n       labeling_args = list(\n         gp_labels = gpar(fontsize = 5),   # Adjust category label font size\n         gp_varnames = gpar(fontsize = 7) # Adjust variable names font size\n       ))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor songwriters, it looks like before 1990, it was dominated by songwriting groups of all white males.\nAfter 1990, however, we once again see a big improvement. We now have a more even split between songwriting groups that are all male and mixed gender (all female groups are extremely rare, apparently). Within both male and mixed gender groups, we see a more even split between mixed race, not white, and white songwriters. Interestingly, both all male and mixed gender groups are dominated by mixed race songwriters!\nFrom the two mosaic plots above, we can conclude that we are indeed seeing a big jump in diversity in the artists and songwriters behind our #1 songs in the Billboard Hot 100. A win for the music industry!",

    "text": "This exploration of the Billboard Hot 100 #1 songs reveals a music landscape in constant flux, shaped by technology, culture, and changing industry dynamics.\nPerhaps the most striking finding is the paradox of the streaming era: we’re simultaneously witnessing both unprecedented chart dominance - with marathon hits like “Old Town Road” commanding the top spot for record-breaking stretches - and unprecedented volatility, where nearly 70% of 2020s #1 songs are one-week wonders. This “winner-takes-all” phenomenon suggests the middle ground has vanished; songs either become cultural juggernauts or flash briefly before being replaced.\nBeyond chart dynamics, we’ve seen music itself transform. The rigid genre boundaries and production formulas of the 20th century have given way to fluid, genre-blending hits where acoustic textures meet dance rhythms and fast tempos don’t necessarily mean happiness.\nMost encouragingly, the faces behind the music have diversified dramatically. What was once a landscape dominated by white male artists and songwriters has evolved into a more representative industry, with artists and songwriters of color and mixed-gender collaborations now claiming substantial space at the top.\nAs we move further into the streaming age, one thing is clear: the only constant in popular music is change itself.\nFuture analysis could explore several intriguing directions: investigating which streaming platforms (Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube) contribute most to Billboard rankings and whether platform-specific metrics can predict chart success; examining why some songs perform exceptionally well on streaming platforms but fail to climb the Billboard charts; or analyzing the relationship between award-winning songs and their chart trajectories to understand what makes them stand out and see if that has evolved over the years.",
