# Introduction

The topic we are interested in exploring for this project is what types of music have historically charted on the Billboard Hot 100, which has published the top 100 songs in the U.S. based on sales, radio play, and streaming weekly since 1958. More specifically, we want to know what makes a song more likely to chart than others; is it something to do with the genre, tempo, energy of the song? The artists featured in the song? The song’s producers? The instruments used in a song? The lyrical composition? Moreover, since the Billboard Hot 100 has existed since 1958, we are interested in seeing how popular music has evolved over time. As an example, a #1 hit in 1960 isn’t directly comparable to a #1 hit in 2010; we are interested in exploring how exactly they differ across multiple metrics.
