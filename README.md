# **The Billboard Hot 100 #1 Songs: What the Top Tells Us About the Evolution of Music**

Authors: Tiffany Peverilla (tp2906) & Suvethika Kandasamy Mohana (sk5697)

### Our Project

This repo contains all source files for our Columbia University STATGR5702 final project exploring the evolution of all songs that have ever hit #1 in the Billboard Hot 100, with [data provided by Chris Dalla Riva, accessible through TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2025/2025-08-26/readme.md). In our project, we ultimately ask ourselves what makes a song #1, and how that definition has changed throughout the years, starting from 1950 to 2025. Along the way, we track variables like genre, sound production, artist structure, collaborations, and more.
